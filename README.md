# graphieros0.2.js
a JS library to edit linear, fractal and molecular graphieros in your HTML

What you need to make it work:

1. stick graphieros0.2.js in the head of your html, as a module
2. format your HTML as follows
    
# linear graphieros

<p>Linear Graphieros needs 2 DIVS in the HTML, the first will host the SVG (let's call it "linear HOST"), the other the glyph phonology inputs from which the parsing will be computed (let's call this one the "linear CODE")</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Linear HOST :</b> give it an ID, and leave it empty</li>
    <li><b>Linear CODE : give it a className. The graphieros phonology must be written as follows: all glyphs of a same word must be separated with a dash; words are separated with a space, punctuation must be separated with spaces. Example: ka-fy-go ma nmo-ka tae . </b>
    </li>
</ul>
